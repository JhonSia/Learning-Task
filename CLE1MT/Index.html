            <p style="background-color:Brown;">Problem: During Typhoon Odette which happened to fall in the beginning of this year, big rains and thunderstorms enveloped bacolod city. As a result, flood prone areas experienced severe flooding with effects ranging from day to day inconveniences to the destruction of lives and properties. In the beginning of March, the City of Bacolod and neighboring cities and municipalities once again experienced heavy rains. Although, the latter had a little to no impact in the communities, but the root cause of it all havenâ€™t been completely resolved. There are to still some inadequacies that are yet to be carefully evaluated and mitigated so as not to cause further damage to lives and properties.</p>
